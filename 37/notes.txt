Different ways of reading a large text file and sending it to the client

Solution 1: Read the file into a variable and send it to the client

Problem: node will have to load the entire file to memory and then send the data
In the LR this can lead to the the node process running out of resources

Everything is written at once into a variable
Entire piece of data is sent back to client

Solution 2: Streams

Streaming the file:
(1) We read one piece of the file
(2) When it's available we send it to the client using .write()
(3) Next piece of data available...
(4) Next piece is sent etc...

Data is sent directly to the client in chunks

Problem: readable stream is faster than sending the result with writable stream which overwhelms the reaponse stream (backpressure)
Backpressure happens when the response can't send data as fast as it is received from the file

Solution 3: Pipe operator

Pipes the output of a readable stream into the input of a writable stream.
Fixes backpressure because it automatically handles speed of data coming in and out.
